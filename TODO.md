# v0.3.0

* BUG: Said Nick won. Brand and Nick powered 13, but Brad had more money.
* BUG: I owned PP 31, but it wouldn't let me buy coal?  It showed 0/6?
  * NOTE: I got rid of an Oil plant and bought a coal.  The new coal is what wasn't working (even though it showed)
  * NOTE: The cause of this was the invalid resource after losing a plant (two bugs, one prompt)
* IMPROVEMENT: Not obvious which plant is up for bid
* IMPROVEMENT: Bidding should happen in action panel.
* BUG: When losing a powerplant, check for invalid resources
* BUG: Step 2 started too soon (during city building)
* BUG: Step 3.  Is the card in there?  Does it work?  Will power plant market adjust?
* BUG: Limit the number of regions
* BUG: Choose which plant to discard
* BUG: Step 3, power plant market not reloaded (cards not put on bottom of deck?)
* BUG: Owned 20,29,42. 15 cities. 5 coal, 2 oil.  It only powered 11 cities???
* BUG: My bid was excessively high... did it remember my old bid or something?
* BUG: Lowest power plant is discarded after each auction round.
* CHECK: Does it discard the 3 when third city built?
* IMPROVEMENT: Make connection string easier (just the host, not the rest - default to onyxoryx)
